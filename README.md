# Car-detection-model-with-CNN
# Project Overview
The Car Detection Model Project is a sophisticated machine learning initiative aimed at developing robust algorithms for detecting and classifying vehicles within images. This project encompasses the full lifecycle of a machine learning solution, including data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation, concluding with the optimization and preservation of the final models. It utilizes advanced deep learning techniques with a focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve its objectives.
