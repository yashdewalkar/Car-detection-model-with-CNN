# Car-detection-model-with-CNN
# Project Overview
The Car Detection Model Project is a sophisticated machine learning initiative aimed at developing robust algorithms for detecting and classifying vehicles within images. This project encompasses the full lifecycle of a machine learning solution, including data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation, concluding with the optimization and preservation of the final models. It utilizes advanced deep learning techniques with a focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve its objectives.

# Project Structure
The project is structured into two major milestones, each addressing a critical phase of the development process:

## Milestone 1: Basic Model Development
Data Importation
The initial phase involves importing a curated dataset that includes images of cars along with their respective annotations. This dataset serves as the foundation for all subsequent model training and testing activities.

Data Mapping
This step establishes a systematic approach to map images to their corresponding classes and annotations, which is crucial for training the models accurately.

Data Visualization
Images are displayed with bounding boxes, a technique used to validate the precision of the annotations and to ensure proper alignment of the model's detection capabilities.

Model Training
We employ basic CNN models to classify cars based on the provided images. This involves constructing and training neural networks to recognize and differentiate between various car models and brands.

Evaluation
The initial models are evaluated using standard metrics to assess their effectiveness in classifying cars correctly. This evaluation helps identify potential areas for improvement in subsequent iterations.

## Milestone 2: Model Optimization and Finalization
### Model Tuning
The second milestone focuses on refining the models to enhance their accuracy and performance. This includes fine-tuning parameters and potentially incorporating more complex neural network architectures.

### Model Saving
Finally, the project concludes with detailed procedures for saving the trained models. This ensures that the models can be deployed or further developed in the future without the need to retrain from scratch.

# Key Insights
The dataset features a diverse range of car brands, with Chevrolet being the most prevalent and brands like Maybach, McLaren, and Porsche appearing less frequently.
The dataset includes cars manufactured between 1991 and 2012, offering a substantial variance in vehicle design and technology for the models to learn from.
Model Performance
The project achieves a preliminary training accuracy of approximately 23% and a validation accuracy of around 6%. These metrics serve as a baseline for the initial models, with significant improvements achieved through further tuning and optimization.

# Technologies Employed
1] Python: The primary programming language used for implementing the machine learning pipeline.

2] Keras & TensorFlow: These libraries are utilized for constructing and training the convolutional neural networks.

3] Matplotlib: Employed for visualizing data and annotations, crucial for verifying the model's performance visually.

## Setup and Execution Instructions
To replicate the results or extend the project:

Ensure that Python 3.x is installed along with Keras, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib.
