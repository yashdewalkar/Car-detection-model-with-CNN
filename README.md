# Car-detection-model-with-CNN
# Project Overview
The Car Detection Model Project is a sophisticated machine learning initiative aimed at developing robust algorithms for detecting and classifying vehicles within images. This project encompasses the full lifecycle of a machine learning solution, including data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation, concluding with the optimization and preservation of the final models. It utilizes advanced deep learning techniques with a focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve its objectives.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
## Key Insights
Chevrolet is the most common car brand in the dataset, while luxury brands like Maybach and McLaren are less represented.
The dataset encompasses cars manufactured between 1991 and 2012, providing a range of technologies and designs for model training.

## Model Performance
The initial models achieve around 23% training accuracy and 6% validation accuracy, with subsequent improvements through fine-tuning.
