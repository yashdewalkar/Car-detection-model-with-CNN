# Car-detection-model-with-CNN
# Project Overview
The Car Detection Model Project is a sophisticated machine learning initiative aimed at developing robust algorithms for detecting and classifying vehicles within images. This project encompasses the full lifecycle of a machine learning solution, including data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation, concluding with the optimization and preservation of the final models. It utilizes advanced deep learning techniques with a focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve its objectives.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running:

bash
